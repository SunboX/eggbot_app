# Patterns And Techniques

This app uses motif families visible in the provided `sorbische_muster` material and common Sorbian egg decoration naming.

## Implemented motif families

- `Punkte`: dotted ornament circles and point clusters.
- `Strahlen`: sun-ray style triangles and mirrored top/bottom rays.
- `Wabe`: honeycomb net structures in center bands.
- `Wolfszähne`: repeating zig-zag / tooth bands.
- `Kiefernzweig`: branch-like vertical ornaments with needle strokes.
- `Feder/Raute`: rhombus chains with feather-like inner linework.

## Color direction

The default palette follows a traditional warm palette family:

- deep red
- deep blue
- ochre / yellow
- light wax-white
- optional green and black accents

You can reduce the design to one color (single wax style) or increase to six colors.

## Generator logic

The generator is deterministic: same settings + same seed gives the same pattern.
Use seed reroll to explore variations without changing other settings.
